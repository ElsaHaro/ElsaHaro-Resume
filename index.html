        <p class="lead mb-4">As a financial advisor, I am also an educator. Part of my task is to help you understand what is involved in meeting your future goals. The education process may include detailed help with financial topics. At the beginning of your relationship, those topics may include budgeting and saving. As you advance in your knowledge, the advisor will assist you in understanding complex investment, insurance, and tax matters. I  will work with you to get a complete picture of your assets, liabilities, income, and expenses. On the questionnaire, you will also indicate future pensions and income sources, project retirement needs, and describe any long-term financial obligations. In short, youâ€™ll list all current and expected investments, pensions, gifts, and sources of income.I, as a financial advisor, is not just someone who helps with investments. My job is to help you with every aspect of your financial life. In fact, you could work with a financial advisor without having them manage your portfolio or recommend any investments at all. Itâ€™s important for you, as the consumer, to understand what your planner recommends and why. You should not follow an advisorâ€™s recommendations unquestioningly; itâ€™s your money, and you should understand how itâ€™s being deployed. Keep a close eye on the fees you are payingâ€”both to your advisor and for any funds bought for you. A commonality among firms is that financial products are selected to fit the clientâ€™s risk profile. Suppose, for example, a 50-year-old individual whoâ€™s already amassed enough net worth for retirement and is predominantly interested in capital preservation. They may have a very conservative asset allocation of 45% in stock assets (which may include individual stocks, mutual funds, and/or exchange-traded funds (ETFs)) and 55% in fixed-income assets such as bonds. Alternatively, a 40-year-old individual with a smaller net worth and a willingness to take on more risk to build up their financial portfolio may opt for an asset allocation of 70% stock assets, 25% fixed-income assets, and 5%alternative investments. Once your investment plan is in place, youâ€™ll receive regular statements from your advisor updating you on your portfolio. The advisor will also set up regular meetings to review your goals and progress and to answer any additional questions you may have. Meeting remotely via phone or video chat can help make those contacts happen more often. Itâ€™s also fine to approach me as your financial advisor when youâ€™re feeling financially secure but you want someone to ensure that youâ€™re on the right track. An advisor can suggest possible improvements to your plan that might help you achieve your goals more effectively. Finally, if you donâ€™t have the time or interest to manage your finances, thatâ€™s another good reason to hire a financial me as your financial advisor. I am really good in helping keep you on track by talking you out of making emotional decisions about your money. For example, buying a stock thatâ€™s been skyrocketing or selling all your stock funds when the market plummets. Thank you !<br><br>
